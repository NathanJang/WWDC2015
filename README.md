# Jonathan Chan: WWDC2015

Please use the `.xcworkspace` file to build and run. `:)`
This app acknowledges and attributes helpful people in `Acknowledgments.txt` and `Attributions.txt`.
To maintain consistency, American English is used throughout the project (with one exception, if you can find it), although I prefer to use British English.

Please also check out `quiz-buzzer` in the project directory (not included in the Xcode workspace).
